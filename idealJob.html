		<h1>My Ideal Job</h1>
			<p>The job position i have chosen as my ideal IT related job  is the Operational Tchnology Officer offered by the Australian Secret Intelligence Service or ASIS.</p>
        <img src="ASISImage.png" alt="ASIS Logo">
		<h3>The Job Position</h3>
			<p>As paraphrased from the ASIS website, someone with the role of an Operational Technology Officer bears the responsibility of developing, testing, maintaining, deploying and operating a variety of technical systems and capabilities. The role is better suited to someone who would rather experience a hands on approach to technical work, underpinned by strong academic and/or relevant work experience. Within the Operational Technology Officer, some of the specialist positions include Applications Developer, System Support, and Infrastructure Specialist.</p>
		<h3>Skills And Experience Required</h3>
			<p>In regards to applying for the role of Operational Technology Officer, a tertiary qualification is not a requirement, however it is reccommended to have obtained a tertiary qualification relating to technology in order to qualify for specialist roles such as Application Developer and Infrastructure Specialist. Regarding personal skills, personal integrity, professionalism, enthusiasm, sound judgement, interpersonal skills, cooperation, and leadership skills are highly sought after and required in order to qualify for the Operational Technology Officer role.</p>
		<h3>Skills And Experience I Currently Have</h3>
			<p>I currently have most-if-not all of the general workforce skills such as leadership, cooperation, sound judgement, interpersonal skills, integrity and professionalism. I have little experience in the field of technology mostly a summation of amateur tinkering and curiosity.</p>
		<h3>My Plan Towards Earning This Job Position</h3>
			<p>I plan on developing experience with technology in order to qualify for this position by earning a Bachelor's Degree In Information Technology in order to gain professional technological knowledge and understanding which I believe would greatly achieve this goal. I plan on developing my workplace skills, physical capabilities and discipline in order to excel in terms of qualifying for this role by joining the Australian Defence Force Army Infantry Reserves which I believe would be greatly effective in achieving this goal. I had chosen the Reserves specifically as it would allow me to train and serve to the same standard as a full-time soldier whilst still allowing me to live my civilian life and earn my Bachelor's Degree In IT which would enable me to more efficiently obtain the skills and qualifications I need to qualify for the role of Operational Technology Officer.</p>
