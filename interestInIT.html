		<h1>My Interest In IT</h1>
        <img src="ITImage.jpg" alt="IT Image">
			<p>My interest in IT didn't start from a specific event, my interest in IT somewhat accumulated the more I was exposed to technology and the more i witnessed its importance in pretty much every dynamic system created by people from traffic, to sociall media, to the electronic polling booth, and even in home appliances eventually integrating every man-made object or system into a unified technological ecosystem or the Internet Of Things(IoT)</p>
		<h2>IT Influences</h2>
			<p>Some of my main influences in gaining an interest in IT or pursuing an IT career were famous attacks such the Stuxnet virus that attacked nuclear reactor centrifuges in Iran via USB, the various attacks committed by the Anonymous hacktivist groups such as the DDOS attack on the Church Of Scientology website in awareness raising of their unjust and immoral activities. Another major influence in my interest in IT is the works of fiction that portray the possibilities of the growing importance and reliance on an understanding of Information Technology such as War Games, Mr Robot, Watch_Dogs, and many other examples.</p>
			<p>These influences highlight the impact that an understanding of information systems has as the world becomes further accustomed to the increase in the interweaving of human nature and technology, further eliminating the ability to distinguish man from machine, introducing avenues of human development as well as the vulnerabilities that could lead to the demise of humanity.</p>
		<h2>Experience In IT</h2>
			<p>My experience in IT hasn't exactly been one of a professional nature, more one of raw curiousity and a desire to tinker and investigate. I have been fortunate to have been around computers for a long time and didn't spark an interest in the workings of computers till I was old enough to comprehend the complexities of technology. At that point I'd collect old computer towers, open them and try to understand the inner workings. I have helped a friend build his first PC which was a rewarding experience. I have taken apart laptops and re-assembled them, I own a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ which runs Kali Linux as a pentesting experimenting setup and a Raspberry Pi Zero W which plan on turning into a headless USB pocket computer.</p>
			<p>In terms of software, the earliest experience i have had on programming was learning to type quizzes and text adventures with MS-DOS on notepad and figuring out how to enable the telnet protocol to watch an ASCII version of Star Wars. Recently I have learned Java and HTML for the purposes of completing this course and growing my IT and programming knowledge which I hope to improve on to the best of my ability.</p>
		<h1>Why RMIT?</h1>
        <img src="RMIT_Logo_mono.png" alt="RMIT Logo">
			<p>I was given the pleasure to study at RMIT as by the time I had decided to turn my interest of IT into a career path I had exhausted my ability to apply via UAC so I had taken a look at opportunities available to someone pursuing a career in IT and I had come across RMIT and their IT course and had decided to act on the opportunity.</p>
		<h2>What I Hope To Learn</h2>
			<p>Throughout this course I hope to learn the skills necessary to be proficient in understanding and navigating information systems to an extent that would enable me to be able to help people and businesses in need of IT services, as well as theoretical and practical knowledge of current and prospering technologies and information systems in terms of both software and hardware.</p>
