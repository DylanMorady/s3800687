		<h1>Brain-Computer Symbiosis(BCS)</h1>
            <img src="BCSImage.jpg" alt="BCS Image" height="auto" with="auto">
		<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>Man has evolved physiologically in order to overcome environmental challenges until the invention of tools and agrigulture. That moment in human history sparked what I like to call "mirror evolution", wherein as opposed to evolving mankind to fit the environment, the environment evolved to fit mankind. This revolution had flourished into what we now know as modern civilisation. I believe that the next step is merging both the intricate apparatus that is the human brain, with the thechnology that has developed to a point where it is essential to modern living, in a symphony of biochemical and electronic synergism.</p>
		<h2>Motivation</h2>
			<p>The motivation to entertain and explore a future where man would be connected to machine at a cognitive level can be accredited to works of Science-Fiction that delve into the potential of a world where mind and machine are intermeshed. Works such as Ghost In The Shell, Altered Carbon, Anon, RoboCop and Transcendence among many others.</p>
		<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>With the rise of the Internet Of Things (IoT) age, the exponential development of technology, and the ever increasing incorporation of technology into every facet of daily life has resulted in a synergy between man and machine. I believe the next frontier of the relationship between man and computer comes with the cooperation of neurobiology and computer science in order to connect the human brain into the vast and advanced network interconnected with the world </p>
		<h2>Tools And Technologies</h2>
			<p>Despite what people may think, technologies today exist that are incredibly promising in realising this vision of the future sooner than expected. The development of OpenBCI, an affordable open source brain-computer interface that is compatible with very inexpensive single-board computers such as the Raspberry Pi and Arduino, provides smaller groups and individuals with access to the technologies necessary for the study and development of brain-computer interfaces. More technology that exists in building upon Brain-Computer Symbiosis(BCS) are the Pixy2 camera, a smart camera developed to make object and line tracking easier and more accessible ot small groups and individuals, and the development of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence for the potential of making visual communication between a person and a machine seamless to a point where even speech is not necessary to communicate with computers, let alone the use of mechanical input devices.</p>
		<h2>Skills Required</h2>
			<p>In order to bring this vision into fruition, we must further develop our understanding of the human brain. Once this is accomplished and the human brain can with sound accuracy be charted, then the developments in artificial intelligence, machine learning and cybernetic implants would need to progress to a point where it would be possible to surgically embed advanced brain-computer interface devices in order to complete Brain-Computer Symbiosis(BCS). From that point developments can be made in order to provide a visual interface in the form of a heads up display, as well as audio simulation or stimulation, so that information that is delivered to the brain can be presented as a visual and audio feed.</p>
		<h2>Outcome</h2>
			<p>The outcome of this endeavour into the future would result in the incredibly seamless communication between an individual and his or her devices, there will come a time where in order to open a door or turn on a light one only needs to think it and it will happen. Controlling remote devices such as drones and remote control toys will be as simple as establishing a connection and thinking of a direction. Internal monologues and mental notes can be recorded as documents. There will come a time where a parent's moment with their child can be saved and treasured literally in the blink of an eye. With this technology, TV's, laptops and phones will become obsolete, there will be no more broken laptops, outdated devices, thus preventing the increase of waste that is thrown away, never to be used again. The world will be more efficient than it has ever been.</p>
