		<h1>My Personal Profile</h1>
			<p>This page will reveal the result of an online Myers-Briggs test,a learning style test, and the truity big five test. After revealing the result of each test, I will summarise the explanation of the result as provided by the test, as well as a reflection paragraph describing my own understanding of the result given after all the results are shown.</p>
		<h2>The 16 Personalities Myers-Briggs Test</h2>
        <img src="Protagonist.png" alt="Protagonist Image">
			<p>On completion of the Myers-Briggs test provided by 16Personalities.com, I was perscribed the personality type of Protagonist or ENFJ-T.</p>
			<p>The 16 personalities site states that "Protagonists are natural-born leaders, full of passion and charisma. Forming around two percent of the population, they are oftentimes our politicians, our coaches and our teachers, reaching out and inspiring others to achieve and go do good in the world. With a natural confidence that begets influence, Protagonists take a great deal of pride and joy in guiding others to work together to improve themselves and their community.</p>
		<h2>The VARK Learning Style Test</h2>
			<p>On completion of this test provided by vark-learn.com, I have been perscribed the Multimodial learning style, specifically both Visual and Kinesthetic learning.</p>
			<p>The vark learning types test reveals that I pertain to the visual and kinesthtic learning types. This means I am able to learn more effectively through visual stimulus such as images, videos and diagrams, as well as the implementation in human interaction methods in order to learn more efficiently and effectiively.</p>
		<h2>The Truity Big Five Test</h2>
			<p>On completion of the truity.com big five test, I had scored:</p>
				<ul>
                    <li>Openness: 			<b>79%</b></li>
                    <li>Conscientiousness: 	<b>52%</b></li>
                    <li>Extraversion: 		<b>60%</b></li>
                    <li>Agreeableness: 		<b>83%</b></li>
                    <li>Neuroticism: 		<b>40%</b></li>
                </ul>
			<p>The results show that I have more of an emotional pattern of personality, thought processes and outlook on life. My most significant trait is my Agreeableness, or my ability to put others' needs ahead of my own and am empathetic of others.</p>
			<h2>Reflection On Test Results</h2>
			<p>All three personal profile tests indicate that I have a desire to place the needs of others above my own, I esentially follow an altruistic or utilitarian moral compass as my actions are comitted with the needs of others in mind. In regards to the Myers-Briggs test from 16 Personalities, i displayed the values of a protagonist, someone who motivates others act on benevolence. This would inspire me to act on the same altruistic values in a group setting, helping my group members to achieve great accomplishments as i find pleasure in helping others succeed resulting in a very positive experience of cooperation. In terms of the VARK learning styles test, my favour of visual sti,ulus and kinesthetic interaction would motivate me to prioritise interaction between the group members and I as well as advocating the use of colors and visuals in a given project in order to captivate the audience. Regaarding the Truity Big Five test, the result is similar to the 16 Personalities test as it highlights my desire to put other's needs and success above my own, displaying altruistic and leadership values in a group environment, emphasising cooperation and benevolence. These personal profile tests, instilled me with a slightly greater sense of leadership and purpose in terms of ensuring the success and satisfaction of others obove my own needs.</p>
